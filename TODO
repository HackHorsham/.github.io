- Need to make the blogs part. { I also want to use Frames not webpages.} - where people can write about things. {This could possibly be a #on social media where people blog, and it turns up on a blogs.html page}
- Need to add in "Events" Page (With links to get tickets.) {Basically [This](https://dev.hackhorsham.org.uk/events) ; but in this theme, and on this page}

- Add this to the main [repo](github.com/HackHorsham)
- Put this on the hackhorsham [ main website](hackhorsham.org) and set the [dev website](dev.hackhorsham.org.uk) to redirect to the main one.
- Use something like Curator.io to embed Social Media feeds. (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.)
